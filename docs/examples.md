The definitive source of truth on how to best use Spring Boot for
VMware GemFire is to refer to the [samples](#geode-samples).

See also the [Temperature
Service](https://github.com/jxblum/temperature-service), Spring Boot
application that implements a temperature sensor and monitoring,
Internet of Things (IOT) example. The example uses SBDG to showcase
VMware GemFire CQ, function implementations and executions, and
positions VMware GemFire as a caching provider in Spring’s Cache
Abstraction. It is a working, sophisticated, and complete example, and
we highly recommend it as a good starting point for real-world use
cases.

See the [Boot
example](https://github.com/jxblum/contacts-application/tree/master/boot-example)
from the contact application reference implementation (RI) for Spring
Data for VMware GemFire (SDG) as yet another example.
